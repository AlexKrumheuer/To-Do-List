This is a simple beginner project built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was my first project of this scale (although not large, it still took some time to complete), and it focuses 
solely on the front-end.

During development, I experimented with a few ideas, such as using classes to create windows (with DisplayCreate and WindowCreate) to streamline the coding process.

This project was inspired, albeit loosely, by the Microsoft To-Do List app.

Ultimately, this was a test project. In the future, as I learn new tools and techniques, I plan to improve it and turn it into a truly useful To-Do List website.
